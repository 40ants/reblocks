;;; This function processes actions that perform operations on dataseq
;;; items. It's in a separate file because there is an issue with
;;; CMUCL and compiling this function transformed through
;;; CL-CONT. CMUCL interpreter, however, works. We'll just add this to
;;; ASDF for all implementations except CMUCL, and for CMUCL this file
;;; will be loaded without compilation.
