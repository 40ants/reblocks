  selectors implement this method. There can be multiple strategies for
  mapping URI tokens to widgets: static maps, dynamically-generated
  widgets, dynamically-generated widgets with caching. Returns a widget
  or NIL if not found. Modifies URI-TOKENS.

  The whole tree update protocol goes like this:

  1) HANDLE-NORMAL-REQUEST calls UPDATE-WIDGET-TREE, which walks the
  tree using WALK-WIDGET-TREE starting at ROOT-WIDGET and calling
  update-children at every node.

  2) The selector's UPDATE-CHILDREN method (valid for all selectors,
  i.e. widgets that process URI tokens) calls GET-WIDGET-FOR-TOKENS.

  3) if a widget corresponding to particular URI tokens is found,
  UPDATE-CHILDREN calls UPDATE-DEPENDENTS, so that the selector (or its
  subclass) may update its dependents list and do other housekeeping.
  The default implementation of UPDATE-DEPENDENTS just calls
  (SETF WIDGET-CHILDREN) to store the children under the :SELECTOR
  type.

  Usually the only thing you'll want to do if you are implementing your
  own kind of selector is to subclass selector and provide a
  GET-WIDGET-FOR-TOKENS method for it. See class ON-DEMAND-SELECTOR for
  an example."))
