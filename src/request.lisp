There are several modes of redirecting:

Immediate redirect (:DEFER NIL): interrupt request processing at once
and send either a `redirect' HTTP response (for normal requests) or
an appropriate JSON command (for AJAX requests).

Deferred redirect (:DEFER (:POST-ACTION|:POST-RENDER); the default
being :POST-RENDER): like immediate redirecting but the execution will be
deferred until action processing (POST-ACTION) or rendering (POST-RENDER)
is finished.

Redirect to new window (NEW-WINDOW=T): opens URI in a new window. The current
request continues to be processed in a normal fashion.
WINDOW-TITLE is the title of the new window, defaulting to the target URI.
DEFER is disregarded in this case.

NEW-WINDOW functionality will only work when Javascript is enabled."
