  Commands are small pieces of information sent to the fronted for execution.
  they are used to update widgets, to load JS or CSS code or to call some other functions
  inside the frontend.

  Right now this mechanism is not really useful because there is no a way to define
  custom commands handler on the frontend. But in the future such facility may be added.
