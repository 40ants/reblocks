# Initial Setup

> It is better to use the latest Reblocks because version from Quicklisp can be outdated.
> You can install the [Ultralisp][Ultralisp] Quicklisp distribution where all Reblocks-related libraries are present and up to date.


Before we start, quickload `reblocks` and create a package for our todo application:

```
(defpackage #:todo
  (:use #:cl)
  (:import-from #:reblocks/widget
                #:render
                #:update
                #:defwidget)
  (:import-from #:reblocks/actions
                #:make-js-form-action
                #:make-js-action)
  (:import-from #:reblocks/app
                #:defapp)
  (:import-from #:reblocks/routes
                #:page)
  (:import-from #:serapeum
                #:soft-list-of)
  (:import-from #:40ants-routes/route-url
                #:route-url)
  (:import-from #:reblocks/html
                #:with-html)
  (:import-from #:reblocks/widgets/string-widget
                #:make-string-widget)
  (:shadowing-import-from #:40ants-routes/defroutes
                          #:get))
(in-package #:todo)
```

# Basic App

Full source of this step is in [here](https://github.com/40ants/reblocks/tree/master/examples/todo/step1.lisp).

At this stage, we will create a simple Reblocks application:

```
(defapp tasks
  :prefix "/"
  :routes ((page ("/" :name "tasks-list")
             (make-string-widget "Hello World!"))))



(defun start (&key (port 8080))
  (reblocks/server:start :port port
                         :apps '(tasks)))

```

By default, the name of the app defines the url where it will
accessible. If we omit PREFIX argument here, then the application
will be accessable at <http://localhost:8080/tasks>. But we want
to make it work at the site's root.

Also pay attention to the ROUTES argument. This is how we can
define a set of application's pages. Previously for the same effect
we have to use a separate ASDF system `reblocks-navigation-widget`,
but now this kind of routing is embedded into the Reblocks.

Run `start` function from the REPL to make our webserver running on port 8080.

Open <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser (double check the port) and you'll see a
text like that:

```
Hello World!
```

During this tutorial we will add features to this simple web application
and finally we'll build the mandatory TODO-list app:

![The TODO-list app in Reblocks](docs/images/quickstart/final.gif)


# Tasks List Page

Full source of this step is in [here](https://github.com/40ants/reblocks/tree/master/examples/todo/step2.lisp).

## Task Model

First of all, we need to define a data-model for keeping information about tasks.
For simplicity of our toy project, we will keep data in the `*store*` hash-table:

```
(defclass task ()
  ((id :initarg :id
       :initform (error "Field ID is required")
       :accessor id
       :type integer)
   (title :initarg :title
          :initform ""
          :accessor title)
   (description :initarg :description
                :initform ""
                :accessor description)
   (done :initarg :done
         :initform nil
         :accessor done)))


(defvar *store* (make-hash-table)
  "Dummy store for tasks: id -> task.")


(defvar *counter* 0
  "Simple counter for the hash table store.")


(defun make-task (title &key done)
  "Create a task and store it by its id."
  (let* ((id (incf *counter*))
         (task (make-instance 'task :title title :done done :id id)))
    (setf (gethash id *store*) task)
    task))


(defun get-task (id)
  (gethash id *store*))
```

Here we've defined the `task` class and the `make-task` function for creating
instances. It isn't mandatory, but it is good practice to do so. Beside of that,
our constructor selects an autoincremented id for a new task.

If you are not familiar with the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), you
can have a look at [Practical Common Lisp][PCL]
and the [Common Lisp Cookbook][CLOS-Cookbook].


## Task List Item

Now we will create a widget to display the list of tasks.

Each item in the list will be a widget itself. It will allow use
to update only the changed piece of data. Here is the code which defines
a list item widget holding the reference to the task object:

```
(defwidget list-item ()
  ((task :initarg :task
         :type task
         :reader task)))


(defun make-list-item (task)
  (make-instance 'list-item
                 :task task))
```

This code defines a `list-item` widget, the building block of our
application. REBLOCKS/WIDGET:DEFWIDGET macro is similar to Common Lisp's DEFCLASS,
in fact it is only a wrapper around it. It takes a name, a list of
super-classes (here `()`) and a list of slot definitions.

We can create a list-item with `make-list-item` function.

Now we need to define a method for REBLOCKS/WIDGET:RENDER generic-function to render
this widget:

```
(defmethod reblocks/widget:render ((list-item list-item))
  (let ((task (task list-item)))
    (with-html ()
      (:p (:input :type "checkbox"
                  :checked (done task))
          (if (done task)
              (:s (title task))
              (title task))))))
```

The REBLOCKS/HTML:WITH-HTML macro uses
[Spinneret][Spinneret] under the hood,
but you can use anything that outputs html.

We can check how the generated html looks like by calling
REBLOCKS/WIDGET:RENDER generic-function in the REPL:


```
TODO> (ql:quickload :reblocks-tests)

TODO> (reblocks-tests/utils:with-test-session ()
          (render
           (make-list-item
            (make-task "Make my first Reblocks app"))))
<div class="widget list-item" id=dom0><p>
  <input type=checkbox>Make my first Reblocks app
</div>
```


## Toggling Task State

To make our task list more useful, we need to allow a user to interact with it.
Let's add an onclick handler which will change task's state from `todo` to `done` and vice versa:

```
(defun toggle (list-item)
  (let ((task (task list-item)))
    (setf (done task)
          (if (done task)
              nil
              t))
    (update list-item)))


(defmethod reblocks/widget:render ((list-item list-item))
  (let ((task (task list-item)))
    (with-html ()
      (:p (:input :type "checkbox"
                  :checked (done task)
                  :onclick (make-js-action
                            (lambda (&key &allow-other-keys)
                              (toggle list-item))))
          (if (done task)
              (:s (title task))
              (title task))))))
```

Here we've defined the `toggle` function which will be called
when user clicks the task list item. Also, we've added `on-click` argument
to the `:input` element. Function REBLOCKS/ACTIONS:MAKE-JS-ACTION
accepts a lisp function and returns a string with JavaScript code which
calls this lisp function from the frontend side.

After changing a task state, `toggle` function calls
REBLOCKS/WIDGET:UPDATE generic-function to send updated widget HTML code
from the backend to the frontend. This mechanism is close to the [HTMX](https://htmx.org/),
but with Reblocks you don't need to define a special API handler for each action
or to embed something into the HTML attributes - Reblocks does this for you and
keeps in the session a closure, created by lambda form.

> **This is really amazing!**
> 
> With Reblocks, you can handle all the business logic on
> server-side, because an action can be any lisp function, even an
> anonymous lambda, closuring all necessary variables.


Here is how our widget will be rendered now:

```
TODO> (reblocks-tests/utils:with-test-session ()
          (render
           (make-list-item
            (make-task "Make my first Reblocks app"))))
<div class="widget list-item" id=dom0><p>
  <input type=checkbox
         onclick="return initiateAction(706:877a48a20059e989576b9c560935aa2588524bab)">
  Make my first Reblocks app
</div>
```


## Rendering a List of Tasks

Now we will created a widget for displaying the list of tasks.

First, we will define a widget and a constructor function:

```
(defwidget task-list ()
  ((items :initarg :items
          :type (soft-list-of list-item)
          :accessor list-items)))


(defun make-task-list (&rest task-titles)
  (let ((items
          (loop for title in task-titles
                for task = (make-task title)
                collect (make-list-item task))))
    (make-instance 'task-list
                   :items items)))

```

The constructor allows to create a bunch of test tasks by giving their titles.

Now let's define a render function for the `task-list` widget:

```
(defmethod reblocks/widget:render ((task-list task-list))
  (with-html ()
    (:h1 "Tasks")
    
    (loop for item in (list-items task-list) do
      (reblocks/widget:render item))))
```


To check how this works, redefine our application like this:

```
(defapp tasks
  :prefix "/"
  :routes ((page ("/" :name "tasks-list")
             (make-task-list "First"
                             "Second"
                             "Third"))))
```

Restart the application and reload the page. Test your form now and see in a
[Webinspector][Webinspector] how Reblocks sends requests to the server and receives
HTML code with rendered HTML block.


At this stage you should see something like that:

![](docs/images/quickstart/step2-1.gif)


## Adding a New Task

To make our application even more usable, we need to create a form for adding new tasks.
Update the method for REBLOCKS/WIDGET:RENDER generic-function like this:

```
(defun add-task (task-list  title)
  (serapeum:push-end (make-list-item (make-task title))
                     (list-items task-list))
  (update task-list))


(defmethod reblocks/widget:render ((task-list task-list))
  (with-html ()
    (:h1 "Tasks")
    
    (loop for item in (list-items task-list) do
      (reblocks/widget:render item))

    ;; Form for adding a new task
    (flet ((on-submit (&key title &allow-other-keys)
             (add-task task-list title)))
      (:form :onsubmit (make-js-form-action #'on-submit)
             (:input :type "text"
                     :name "title"
                     :placeholder "Task's title")
             (:input :type "submit"
                     :class "button"
                     :value "Add")))))
```

Here we've used REBLOCKS/ACTIONS:MAKE-JS-FORM-ACTION function to create a JavaScript code
for calling the `on-submit` function on the backend.
This callback just calls `add-task` function which created a new list item and calls REBLOCKS/WIDGET:UPDATE
generic-function to update the whole list of tasks.

If you need to work with large lists or complex data, then it is better to update not the whole collection
widget but only insert a new item into the DOM. To accomplish this, you can provide an INSERTED-AFTER argument
to REBLOCKS/WIDGET:UPDATE generic-function:


```
(defun add-task (task-list  title)
  (let ((last-item (alexandria:last-elt
                    (list-items task-list)))
        (new-item (make-list-item (make-task title))))
    (serapeum:push-end new-item
                       (list-items task-list))

    ;; This time we are calling update on a new list item:
    (update new-item
            ;; And providing to the frontend
            ;; a hint that we've inserted this new-item
            ;; after the some other item:
            :inserted-after last-item)))
```


Right now it should look like this:

# Adding Details Page

Full source of this step is in [here](https://github.com/40ants/reblocks/tree/master/examples/todo/step3.lisp).

Now, we'll add an ability to open the task details page. There are few possibilities to accomplish this task in the Reblocks:

1. We can make a \"single page application\" and when user clicks on a list item, the whole list widget will be replaced with a widget showing details about the task. This is good if we are building a widget to be embedded into some other page where we don't want to change the URL. But in this scenario we also need to implement controls for returning back to the tasks list or hook into browser's API for managing history state. Also, in this mode all states of the application will have the same URL and it will be impossible for user to share a link to a single task.
2. We can implement a classical web-app where task details page will have it's own URL. This makes history and sharing works as user expects. For this reason and also to show you how routing works in Reblocks, we'll go by this way.


## Task Details Widget

For showing task details we need yet another widget. You see, a widget is a representation of some data and there could be a multiple kinds of representation for the same data! In our example, the same task might be rendered as a list item or as a whole page's content.

To render task with all details, define a `task-page` widget like this:

```
(defwidget task-page ()
  ((task :initarg :task
         :type task
         :accessor task)
   (edit-mode-p :initform nil
                :type boolean
                :accessor edit-mode-p)))


(defun make-task-page (task-id)
  (let ((task (get-task task-id)))
    (cond
      (task (make-instance 'task-page
                           :task task))
      (t
       (reblocks/response:not-found-error
        (format nil "Task with id ~A not found."
                task-id))))))

```

Note, the constructor calls to REBLOCKS/RESPONSE:NOT-FOUND-ERROR function which will
interrupt request processing and show an 404 error page to the user. This function
accepts a text or a widget, so you might define a widget to render 404 page as you like!

Now we need to write a render method for the `task-page` widget:

```
(defmethod render ((task-page task-page))
  (let ((task (task task-page))
        ;; This is the way how we can get URL path
        ;; pointing to another page without hardcoding it.
        (list-url (route-url "tasks-list")))
    (with-html ()
      (:div :style "display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 1rem"
            (:h1 :style "display: flex; gap: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0"
                 (:b (if (done task)
                         "[DONE]"
                         "[TODO]"))
                 (:span :style "font-weight: normal"
                        (title task)))
            (:div (if (string= (description task) "")
                      "No defails on this task."
                      (description task)))
            (:div :style "display: flex; gap: 1rem"
                  (:a :href list-url
                      "Back to task list."))))))
```

Pay attention how we did use ROUTE-URL to get URL of the page with tasks list. If we would hardcode here
something like `/`, then our applications URL become incorrect in case if this application will be
mounted to the server using some prefix like `/tasks/`, but ROUTE-URL function will always give a correct path.

## New Route

Talking about the routing, now we need to redefine routes of our application and add a new page:

```
(defapp tasks
  :prefix "/"
  :routes ((page ("/<int:task-id>" :name "task-details")
             (make-task-page task-id))
           (page ("/" :name "tasks-list")
             (make-task-list "First"
                             "Second"
                             "Third"))))
```

Here we've defined a new page like this:

```
(page ("/<int:task-id>" :name "task-details")
  (make-task-page task-id))
```

Path `"/<int:task-id>"` tell Reblocks to extract an argument TASK-ID if URL matches to the route, and
this variable will be bound during handler body `(make-task-page task-id)` execution.

Also, note that this route has a NAME argument with `"task-details"` value. Now we can use this name
to get an URL of this new page using ROUTE-URL function.

## Referring to a New Page

Let's adjust render method of tasks-list widget to make it use ROUTE-URL for linking to the task's page:

```
(defmethod reblocks/widget:render ((list-item list-item))
  (let* ((task (task list-item))
         ;; Here we are referring to the new task page:
         (details-url
           (route-url "task-details"
                      :task-id (id task))))
    (with-html ()
      (:p (:input :type "checkbox"
                  :checked (done task)
                  :onclick (make-js-action
                            (lambda (&key &allow-other-keys)
                              (toggle list-item))))
          (:a :href details-url
              (if (done task)
                  (:s (title task))
                  (title task)))))))
```

Now our web application should work like this:

# Editing Task

Now our app almost functional. The only thing we are lacking is an ability to edit
task's title and description. Let's modify task details page to include an edit mode!

What we will do is add a state flag to the task details widget. When the flag is true, we
will show a editable form instead of usual representation of the task:

```
(defmethod render ((task-page task-page))
  (cond
    ;; Edit mode
    ((edit-mode-p task-page)

Here is how our app will work now:

# What is next?

As a homework:

1. Play with lambdas and add a \"Delete\" button next after
   each task.
2. Add the ability to sort tasks by name or by completion flag.
3. Save tasks in a database (this [Cookbook chapter][DB-Cookbook] might help).
4. Read the REBLOCKS/DOC/ROUTING:@ROUTING section.
5. Read the rest of the documentation and make a real application, using the full
   power of Common Lisp.
