Running the demo should be easy!

1. Configure elephant and ensure that the test suite runs.
2. Check in conf/stores.lisp to choose a different store spec if 
   you don't have Elephant configured to work with the Berkeley DB
3. Load WEBLOCKS-ELEPHANT-DEMO into the Lisp environment.
4. Run the (WEBLOCKS-ELEPHANT-DEMO:START-WEBLOCKS-ELEPHANT-DEMO) command.
