;; Define callback function to initialize new sessions. The function
;; initializes a sandbox store for the new user and sets up a
;; continuation flow. It then renders the initial page.
;;
;; After the initial page answers, INIT-USER-SESSION sets
;; RENDER-HEADER as a prefix for the main composite so that header is
;; seen on all pages (similar behavior could be accomplished by
;; placing this function into the layout made by MAKE-MAIN-PAGE, but
;; this would prevent the header from being displayed in some cases
;; like dialogs invoked with JavaScript turned off).
;;
;; The control is then passed to main page. The main page is never
;; expected to answer.
