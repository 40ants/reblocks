To run, you'll need to modify the paths in rundemo.lisp to match
your system, then just run that (i.e. "sbcl --load rundemo.lisp") or
whatever.  Note that you'll get the REPL back with very little
feedback; this means the server is running on port 8080.

To see the demo be persistent across different runs of the server,
comment out every reference to the sandbox store, and in cases where
simply commenting them out won't work (i.e. (find-persistent-objects
(sandbox-store) ...)) replace (sandbox-store) with
*prevalence-store*
