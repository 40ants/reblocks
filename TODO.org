* Roadmap
** DONE Make hooks system easier to use
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2017-09-11 Mon 09:59]
Get rid of distinction between :pre :post and :dynamic hooks

Code for adding a hook should look like:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp

(add-application-hook my-hook ()
  (some-code-of-implementation)
  (call-next-hook))

#+END_SRC

Instead of

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp

(defun my-hook (hooks)
   (some-code-of-implementation)
   (eval-dynamic-hooks hooks))

(add-application-hook :pre-render
                      my-hook)
#+END_SRC
** TODO Process (declare ...) forms in add-xxxx-hook macrose
Need to place these forms in the top of flet from
** TODO Make a package per file in all codebase
** TODO Remove all special widgets with html rendering code into separate weblocks-ui library
