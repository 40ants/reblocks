- Quirks mode - anything before doctype/incorrect doctype
- Incorrect overflow issue (set overflow to hidden)
- min-width doesn't work (use dynamic properties)
  (to do: .table min-width)
- border-spacing doesn't work (replace with border-collapse?)
- Not declaring a width along with negative margins causes extremely weird rendering bugs
