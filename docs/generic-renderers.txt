10. Create a data-grid widget (pageable, sortable, along with ajaxy view and edit functionality that automagically scales back)
11. Create an ajaxy modal "dialog" widget along with appropriate machinery, as well as modal request in general.
11.5. Figure out how to deal with
   - slots that are collections
     - don't render at all
     - render as links to data grids
     - if small collection, render member names inline
     - for forms, open grids to select, show dropdown, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.
   - non-inline CLOS objects in forms
