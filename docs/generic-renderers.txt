TODO:
-----
- Improve navigation (titles, etc.)
- Make sure menu and its items are wrapped in appropriate divs (including menus like in "articles")
- Make sure widgets, composites, etc. are wrapped in appropriate divs with proper class names
- Unit Test and document init-composite and make-composite
- Make navigation use friendly URLs
- Unit Test and document navigation (including empty)
- Rethink the way styles are applied to renderers

----
- Create menu
- Create a data-grid widget (pageable, sortable, along with ajaxy functionality that scales back)
- Create an ajaxy modal "dialog" widget with relevant machinery, as well as modal request in general.
- Create renderers for lists
- Figure out how to deal with
  - slots that are collections
    - don't render at all
    - render as links to data grids
    - if small collection, render member names inline
    - for forms, open grids to select, show dropdown, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.
  - non-inline CLOS objects in forms
- Authentication (permission to access menu items, actions, widgets in general)
- Think of navigation widgets with dynamic items (to list articles, products, etc.)
- Consider "action parameters" - map http parameters to action function argument symbols
- Consider redirecting to hide all non user-friendly actions on non-ajax requests (consider debug toolbar)

----
- Add "linguistic code" and convert form validations (types, etc.) to use it.
- Make sure data and form renderer labels show attributized slot name class for styling
- Mark required fields
- Don't remove validation error summary for long forms.
- Focus on the control being modified (#anchor), possibly change title. (More accessible/friendly).
- Standardize renderers return values (deferring until more is known about what's useful)
- Fix the bug where in strict mode one must do (address first-name) instead of just (first-name)

----
- Release the library/write articles.
- Create a reference application.
- Rewrite defmacro
