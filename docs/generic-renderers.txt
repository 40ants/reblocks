11.1. Standardize renderers return values (deferring until more is known about what's useful)
11.2. Create renderers for lists
11.3. Fix the bug where in strict mode one must do (address first-name) instead of just (first-name)
11.5. Figure out how to deal with
   - slots that are collections
     - don't render at all
     - render as links to data grids
     - if small collection, render member names inline
     - for forms, open grids to select, show dropdown, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.
   - non-inline CLOS objects in forms
12. Create menu and other widgets
12.5. Rewrite defmacro
