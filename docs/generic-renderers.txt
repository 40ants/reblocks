TODO:
1. document unit test, and determine symbols export status:
   - request handler, page template
3. Improve generic form readers (ensure slot type info is honored when parsing data and inner slots are updated.)
7.1. Port to OSX
9.1. Make sure data and form renderer labels show attributized slot name class for styling
9.2. Make sure attributized slot names in form and data renderers refer to original slot name (in case modified by :slots, this is necessary to read back input properly)
-----
9.5. Allow specifying standard as well as custom validations on fields and objects
10. Create a data-grid widget (pageable, sortable, along with ajaxy view and edit functionality that automagically scales back)
11. Create an ajaxy modal "dialog" widget along with appropriate machinery, as well as modal request in general.
11.1. Standardize renderers return values (deferring until more is known about what's useful)
11.2. Create renderers for lists
11.3. Fix the bug where in strict mode one must do (address first-name) instead of just (first-name)
11.5. Figure out how to deal with
   - slots that are collections
     - don't render at all
     - render as links to data grids
     - if small collection, render member names inline
     - for forms, open grids to select, show dropdown, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.
   - non-inline CLOS objects in forms
12. Create menu and other widgets
12.5. Rewrite defmacro
13. Create a reference application.
14. Release the library/write articles.
