 Welcome to weblocks's documentation!
=========================================

This is the user's guide to Weblocks.
Weblocks is a web framework for Common Lisp.

.. note:: This is not original Weblocks, it is a fork with completely
          changed API.
          
          Read :doc:`quickstart`, because all other sections were not updated
          yet and have incomplete or outdated information.

.. warning:: This version of Weblocks is not in the Quicklisp yet. To
             install it you need to clone the repository somewhere where
             ASDF will find it, for example, to ``~/common-lisp/`` directory.
