.. warning:: This section is outdated and belongs to the old Weblocks documention.

             SHOULD BE REWRITTEN. Probably we need only to link to the

Forms enable the user to communicate with a web application.

Usually the server side action boils down to selecting, modifying, creating or
deleting data sets (this is sometimes abbreviated as CRUD: Create/Read/Update/Delete)

Building web forms is usually a cumbersome process. Elaborate but
complicated solutions have been devised [#php-quickform]_, but so far we
haven't found any of them to match the ease of use and flexibility of
Weblocks' declarative view DSL.


Introduction
============

The form mechanism consists of two parts, the ``DATAFORM`` widget and
the ``FORM-VIEW`` view type.

Forms are usually built by defining form views using the ``DEFVIEW`` macro
and instantiating a ``DATAFORM`` object with this view.


Simple example
==============

Let's define a view for creating and editing bug reports.

Let the model be defined thus:

.. code:: common-lisp
          
   (defclass bug-report ()
     ((id :type integer :initform (create-unique-id))
      (status :type (member :new :open :resolved) :initform :new)
      (summary :type string)
      (body :type string)))

This view should apply to users that are not developers: they may
enter a summary and body but that's it.

.. code:: common-lisp
          
   (defview bug-report-form-view
       (:type form :inherit-from '(:scaffold bug-report)
        :caption "Enter a bug report")
     (id :hidep t)
     (status :hidep t))

The ``SUMMARY`` and ``BODY`` fields will default to
strings; every form field is presented as a text input and parsed as a
string by default.

Let's use this view to derive the view for developers:

.. code:: common-lisp
          
   (defview bug-report-form-view/developer
       (:type form :inherit-from 'bug-report-form-view )
     (status :hidep nil))

The status field will automatically be displayed as a dropdown control
since the scaffold inspector has decided this upon the slot's type.

You can define scaffolding rules for your own types.

.. note:: TODO: document this somewhere.

As part of the validation process Weblocks will also check whether a
user input matches the slot's type regardless of whether you use
scaffolding or not.


But let's assume that we want custom labels for the dropdown:

.. code:: common-lisp

   (defview bug-report-form-view/developer
       (:type form :inherit-from 'bug-report-form-view )
     (status :hidep nil
             :present-as (dropdown :choices '(("This report is totally new, don't trust it!" . :new)
                                              ("Yeah okay, we're working on it." . :open)
                                              ("We've solved that problem already..." . :resolved)))))


Quickforms
==========

Quickforms are specialized Dataforms.

They provide a way to build forms based entirely on a view; they are handy
for operations where you don't have the user working on an actual model instance.

Let's dive right into it:

.. code:: common-lisp
          
   (make-quickform 
     (defview nil 
       (:caption "A Quickform" :type form :persistp nil)
       (some-text  :present-as input))
     :on-success (lambda (form data)
       (with-html 
         "Submitted data - "
         (str (slot-value data 'some-text)))))

This will display form with single field. After form submit we'll see text with value submitted.
``data`` object here is a class created dynamically from view fields.

.. code:: common-lisp

   :persistp nil

in view definition is necessary, we don't want dynamic class to persist.

There are options in ``make-quickform`` for validation, control flow and other things.
See ``make-quickform`` documentation (http://quickdocs.org/weblocks/api)
