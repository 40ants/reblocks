TODO:
-- CURRENT (ajax suggest) --
- Add a degradeable ajax suggest widget (local -> dropdown)
- Unit test
- Incorporate it into selecting state in forms

-- LARGE FEATURES --
- Create a degradable isearch control
- Create a gridsearch control
- Design paging control for datagrid
- Create a gridedit control based on datagrid and dataform
- Create a modal dialog widget, as well as modal request in general
- Handling failure (AJAX and regular, add message types to flash widget)
- Controls that expose state on the URL, AJAX and POST/GET, back button/history research

-- RESEARCH --
- slots that are collections (links to data grid popups, inline, dropdowns, radio buttons, etc.)
- non-inline CLOS objects in forms
- Consider "action parameters" - map http parameters to action function argument symbols
- Consider redirecting to hide all non user-friendly actions on non-ajax requests (consider debug toolbar)
- (Use widget names?) to show headings to improve accessibility. Concentrate on heading structure.
- Focus on the control being modified (#anchor), possibly change title. (More accessible/friendly).
- Register stylesheet requirements, deal with paths to stylesheets and images
- Preload ajax image and navigation arrow

-- MINOR FEATURES --
- Add "linguistic code" and convert form validations (types, etc.) to use it.
- Mark required fields
- Don't remove validation error summary for long forms.
- Standardize renderers return values (deferring until more is known about what's useful)
- Fix the bug where in strict mode one must do (address first-name) instead of just (first-name)
- Handle error pages nicely
- Customize widget printing to include their names (to ease debugging)
- Highlight rows while hoovering over table (and data/forms?)
- Port stylesheets to IE, browser compatibility, offer simpe HTML version for older browsers
- Move datagrid specific stylesheets from table.css to datagrid.css
- Give every session separate instances of data
- Consider using Yahoo fonts CSS
- Reset sessions should respect friendly URL

-- BIGGER PICTURE --
- Release the library/write articles.
- Create a reference application.
- Rewrite defmacro

-- WISHLIST --
- Authentication (permission to access menu items, actions, widgets in general)
- Consider lazy evaluation of session initialization
- Create default title page if the user didn't define the application (possibly tutorial style)
- Consider multiple navigation controls in one composite, hidden navigation controls, dynamic menus
- Reset state of regular widgets when moving accross navigation controls?
- Create renderers for lists (redo existing renderers that use lists with these?)
