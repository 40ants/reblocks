TODO:
-- CURRENT (data-grid) --
- Allow adding actions to each row
- Design paging control
- Consider "navigateable grids" that keep sorting/paging information on the URL

-- LARGE FEATURES --
- Add a widget similar to google suggest
- Create a gridsearch control
- Create a gridedit control based on datagrid and dataform
- Create a modal dialog widget, as well as modal request in general
- Rethink the application keeping AJAX in mind

-- RESEARCH --
- slots that are collections (links to data grid popups, inline, dropdowns, radio buttons, etc.)
- non-inline CLOS objects in forms
- Consider "action parameters" - map http parameters to action function argument symbols
- Consider redirecting to hide all non user-friendly actions on non-ajax requests (consider debug toolbar)
- (Use widget names?) to show headings to improve accessibility. Concentrate on heading structure.
- Focus on the control being modified (#anchor), possibly change title. (More accessible/friendly).
- Register stylesheet requirements, deal with paths to stylesheets and images

-- MINOR FEATURES --
- Add "linguistic code" and convert form validations (types, etc.) to use it.
- Mark required fields
- Don't remove validation error summary for long forms.
- Standardize renderers return values (deferring until more is known about what's useful)
- Fix the bug where in strict mode one must do (address first-name) instead of just (first-name)
- Handle error pages nicely
- Customize widget printing to include their names (to ease debugging)
- Highlight rows while hoovering over table (and data/forms?)
- Port stylesheets to IE
- Move datagrid specific stylesheets from table.css to datagrid.css

-- BIGGER PICTURE --
- Release the library/write articles.
- Create a reference application.
- Rewrite defmacro

-- WISHLIST --
- Authentication (permission to access menu items, actions, widgets in general)
- Consider lazy evaluation of session initialization
- Create default title page if the user didn't define the application (possibly tutorial style)
- Consider multiple navigation controls in one composite, hidden navigation controls, dynamic menus
- Reset state of regular widgets when moving accross navigation controls?
- Create renderers for lists (redo existing renderers that use lists with these?)
