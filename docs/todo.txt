TODO:
-- CURRENT (Port to IE) --
- Hover related behaviors stop working on ajax
- Isearch doesn't work
- When adding an item to gridedit, no margin under dataform (in all browsers)
- Progress bar often doesn't show up

-- LARGE FEATURES --
- Design paging control
- Allow viewing/editing by clicking on a row/link column in gridedit
- Create a modal dialog widget, as well as modal request in general
- Deleting confirmation in datagrid
- Handling failure (AJAX and regular, add message types to flash widget)
- Controls that expose state on the URL, AJAX and POST/GET, back button/history research
- Convert states to render using suggest block (specialize on nil, validate, proper display of data)

-- RESEARCH --
- Consider redirecting to hide all non user-friendly actions on non-ajax requests (consider debug toolbar)
- Focus on the control being modified (#anchor), possibly change title. (More accessible/friendly).
- Register stylesheet requirements, deal with paths to stylesheets and images
- Consider redoing flash widget with modal style in mind (widget specific modality?)

-- MINOR FEATURES --
- Mark required fields
- Port stylesheets to IE, browser compatibility, offer simpe HTML
  version for older browsers
- Give every session separate instances of data
- Consider using Yahoo fonts CSS
- Fix friendly URLs and form actions in w3m
- Allow adding titles to navigation items and set them as page title, add application title
