-- LARGE FEATURES --
- Design paging control for datagrid

- Create a modal dialog widget, as well as modal request in general
- Handling failure (AJAX and regular, add message types to flash widget)
- Controls that expose state on the URL, AJAX and POST/GET, back button/history research
- Convert states to render using suggest block (specialize on nil, validate, proper display of data)

-- RESEARCH --
- slots that are collections (links to data grid popups, inline, dropdowns, radio buttons, etc.)
- non-inline CLOS objects in forms
- Consider redirecting to hide all non user-friendly actions on non-ajax requests (consider debug toolbar)
- (Use widget names?) to show headings to improve accessibility. Concentrate on heading structure.
- Focus on the control being modified (#anchor), possibly change title. (More accessible/friendly).
- Register stylesheet requirements, deal with paths to stylesheets and images
- Preload ajax image and navigation arrow
- Consider redoing flash widget with modal style in mind

  compatibility, offer simpe HTML version for older browsers
