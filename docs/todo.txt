TODO:
-- CURRENT (gridedit) --
- Add delete functionality based on select
- Don't show selection bar when there is one or less items
- Should sorting and item operations reset selection?
- Fix, document, refactor, unit test datagrid and gridedit
- Highlight selected rows
- What happens when user tries to delete and nothing is selected?
- Deleting confirmation
- Allow viewing/editing by clicking on a row/link column
- Test in w3m/safari/openmcl

-- LARGE FEATURES --
- Design paging control for datagrid
- Create a modal dialog widget, as well as modal request in general
- Handling failure (AJAX and regular, add message types to flash widget)
- Controls that expose state on the URL, AJAX and POST/GET, back button/history research
- Convert states to render using suggest block (specialize on nil, validate, proper display of data)

-- RESEARCH --
- slots that are collections (links to data grid popups, inline, dropdowns, radio buttons, etc.)
- non-inline CLOS objects in forms
- Consider redirecting to hide all non user-friendly actions on non-ajax requests (consider debug toolbar)
- (Use widget names?) to show headings to improve accessibility. Concentrate on heading structure.
- Focus on the control being modified (#anchor), possibly change title. (More accessible/friendly).
- Register stylesheet requirements, deal with paths to stylesheets and images
- Preload ajax image and navigation arrow
- Consider redoing flash widget with modal style in mind (widget specific modality?)
- Refactor out forms
- Consider refactoring parts of regex filtering and sorting into utils
- Optimize/cache getting data from grid

-- MINOR FEATURES --
- Mark required fields
- Don't remove validation error summary for long forms.
- Customize widget printing to include their names (to ease debugging)
- Port stylesheets to IE, fix the form bug for Opera 8, browser
  compatibility, offer simpe HTML version for older browsers
- Give every session separate instances of data
- Consider using Yahoo fonts CSS
- Reset sessions should respect friendly URL
- Fix friendly URLs not being respected in w3m
- Allow adding titles to navigation items and set them as page title, add application title

-- WISHLIST --
- Allow multiple search tokens in grid searchbar
- Authentication (permission to access menu items, actions, widgets in general)
- Consider lazy evaluation of session initialization
- Create default title page if the user didn't define the application (possibly tutorial style)
- Consider multiple navigation controls in one composite, hidden navigation controls, dynamic menus
- Reset state of regular widgets when moving accross navigation controls?
- Create renderers for lists (redo existing renderers that use lists with these?)
- Tooltips/balloon widget/block
- Integrate selecting items with paging (allow selecting beyond current page?)
