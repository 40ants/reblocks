TODO:
-- CURRENT --
- Fix broken tests

-- LARGE FEATURES --
- Create a pageable, sortable data-grid widget
- Rethink the application keeping AJAX in mind
- Create a modal dialog widget, as well as modal request in general
- Add a widget similar to google suggest
- Register stylesheet requirements, deal with paths to stylesheets and images

-- RESEARCH --
- Figure out how to deal with
  - slots that are collections
    - don't render at all
    - render as links to data grids
    - if small collection, render member names inline
    - for forms, open grids to select, show dropdown, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.
  - non-inline CLOS objects in forms
- Authentication (permission to access menu items, actions, widgets in general)
- Consider "action parameters" - map http parameters to action function argument symbols
- Consider redirecting to hide all non user-friendly actions on non-ajax requests (consider debug toolbar)
- Consider lazy evaluation of session initialization
- Create default title page if the user didn't define the application (possibly tutorial style)
- Think of navigation widgets with dynamic items (to list articles, products, etc.)
- Consider multiple navigation controls in one composite and hidden navigation controls
- Reset state of regular widgets when moving accross navigation controls?
- Create renderers for lists (redo existing renderers that use lists with these?)
- (Use widget names?) to show headings to improve accessibility. Concentrate on heading structure.

-- MINOR FEATURES --
- Add "linguistic code" and convert form validations (types, etc.) to use it.
- Make sure data and form renderer labels show attributized slot name class for styling
- Mark required fields
- Don't remove validation error summary for long forms.
- Focus on the control being modified (#anchor), possibly change title. (More accessible/friendly).
- Standardize renderers return values (deferring until more is known about what's useful)
- Fix the bug where in strict mode one must do (address first-name) instead of just (first-name)
- Handle error pages nicely
- Customize widget printing to include their names (to ease debugging)
- Highlight rows while hoovering over table (and data/forms?)
- Port stylesheets to IE

-- BIGGER PICTURE --
- Release the library/write articles.
- Create a reference application.
- Rewrite defmacro
