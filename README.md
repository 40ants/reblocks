# Introduction

[![](https://ultralisp.org/projects/40ants/reblocks.svg)][52cc]

Reblocks is a fork of the Weblocks web framework written by Slava Akhmechet
and maintained by Scott L. Burson and Olexiy Zamkoviy.

Some time ago I (Alexander Artemenko) found this old Weblocks and liked its idea
of building web applications out of widgets. But the framework's code was complex
and hard to change. Thus I decided to refactor it into a smaller core plus
separate libraries implementing more advanced features.

For a few years this refactored code lived in the repository https://github.com/40ants/weblocks and
it was possible to install it from Ultralisp only. I didn't publish it
to Quicklisp to not break sites using the old version of Weblocks. But in January 2022
I decided to rename the `ASDF` system to "reblocks" to make it installable from
Quicklisp under this name.

## Core Features of Reblocks

* Application pages are built from "widgets".
* All business logic can be implemented in Common Lisp on the server-side.
* The framework's code is separated by functionality into separate packages.
* The project now has [hyperlinked documentation][22e2]
  with code snippets and embedded interactive demos.

The framework's `API` is still under active development. All significant changes are
described in the [`ChangeLog`][c52e]. You can add the ChangeLog page
to your `RSS` reader to be notified of new releases.

## Removed Features

These features are present in the old-school Weblocks version but were removed
from the core of Reblocks. Some of them might be implemented as separate `ASDF`
systems.

* Views
* Templates
* Forms
* Continuation based dialogs

You can read about these tools in the [`Removed Features`][1505] section.

## Learning Reblocks

To learn how to use Reblocks to build a simple single-page application, proceed to the
[`Quickstart`][4851] section.

To learn how a real-world application can be built,
inspect [Ultralisp's][2a0d] code:
