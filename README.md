# Introduction

Reblocks is the fork of the Weblocks web frameworks written by Slava Akhmechet
and maintained by Scott L. Burson and Olexiy Zamkoviy.

Some time ago I (Alexander Artemenko) found this old Weblocks and liked its idea
of building web application out of widgets. But framework's code was complex
and hard to change. Thus I decided to refactor it into a smaller core plus
separate libraries implementing more advanced features.

A few years this refactored code lived in the repository https://github.com/40ants/weblocks and
it was possible to install it from Ultralisp only. I didn't publish it
to Quicklisp to not break sites using old version of the Weblocks. But at January 2022
I decided to rename `ASDF` system into the "reblocks" to make it installable from
the Quicklisp under this name.

## Core Features of Reblocks

* Application pages are built from "widgets".
* All business logic could be implemented in Common Lisp in server-side.
* Framework's code is separated by functionality into a separate packages.
* Project now has a [hyperlinked documentation][22e2]
  with code snippets and embedded interactive demos.

Framework's `API` is still under active development. All significant changes are
described in the [`ChangeLog`][6f26]. You can add ChangeLog page
into your `RSS` reader to be notified on new releases.

## Removed Features

These features are present in the oldshool Weblocks version but were removed
from the core of the Reblocks. Some of them might be implemented as a separate `ASDF`
systems.

* Views
* Templates
* Forms
* Continuation based dialogs

You can read about these tools in the [`Removed Features`][c521] section.

## Learning Reblocks

To learn, how to use Reblocks to build a simple single-page application, proceed to the
[`Quickstart`][ebbe] section.

To learn how a real-world application can be built,
inspect [Ultralisp's][2a0d] code:
